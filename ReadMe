About Minecraft Shell Library
=============================
An API for Minecraft / Forge / Bukkit server management and scripting.


Installation
============
You'll need to know the location of your Minecraft server root directory (the place where you have your server.properties file), and the operating system user and group it runs under.

After that just type "make install" and answer those questions.

For an initial installation, you'll have to tweak the settings to your taste in the .server-settings installed file.
Else verify if there are new configuration items to import in your existing server configuration.

Also add the Commands and Scripts subdirectories to the PATH of your Minecraft system account.


Usage
=====
Include the following line near the start of your shell scripts:

. .minecraft-library

Then you can use all the functions in the library.

Check Scripts/mcchat for a little example.

The functions list is located at the start of the .minecraft-library file.
For parameters, check each function header.

The library is fully documented at the following Web address:

Caveats
=======
Developed and tested only on FreeBSD 10.1.

Further development plans
=========================
I'm considering to add custom shell commands, which could be implemented either through a non existent /-prefixed command to be caught in the server log, through a "/mail send" Bukkit Essentials command sent to an admin account, or better through a gateway mod or plugin which would also pass additional info (player position, item held, block being aimed at, etc.).

Everybody is also welcome to complete the forbidden client side mods list.
